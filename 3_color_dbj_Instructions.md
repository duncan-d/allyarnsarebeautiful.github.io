# 3 Color DBJ - Using KR-850

## Cast on ##

1. Thread your machine (including 4 color changer)
  * Thread everything except your white yarn through tension mast and color changer.

  * Use fine knitting bar if available

  ![Inserting Fine Knitting Bar](/assets/3dbj/fnb_insert.jpg)
  * Set needles up for full needle rib
    * Every needle selected
    * Pitch lever set to half
    ![Half Pitch Lever](/assets/3dbj/half_pitch_lever.jpg)
    * Even number of needles on ribber
    * An extra needle on each side of ribber if available

2. Main carriage settings
  * Set knob to N-L
  * Set an appropriate tension (lower than tension setting for knitting)
  * No buttons depressed
  ![main_normal](/assets/3dbj/main_normal.jpg)
3. Ribber carriage settings
  * II, no lili, N, N, R, N, N, no lili
  * same tension as main carriage

4. While holding yarn under the machine pass carriage from right to left this will form a "zig-zag" row. If your last few stitches are tighter than the rest pull the needles back until they match the rest.

5. Hang cast on comb and plenty of weights

6. Remove wire from comb
7. Bring comb upwards between the beds and stick "pins" of comb up between the zig-zag

8. Reinsert wire and let comb drop to let the wire rest on the zig-zag
![wire_in](/assets/3dbj/wire_in.jpg)
9. Hang weights - DBJ is usually more successful with a hefty amount of weight. Put the hooks of the weights through the holes on the bottom of the csat-on comb.
10. Set main carriage to part right and ribber to part left by depressing the part :arrow_forward: button on main carriage and moving the slider on the left side of the ribber carriage from N to P*R

![ribber_part_left](/assets/3dbj/ribber_part_left.jpg)
11. Dial up tension 
12. Make 2 passes ending up with carriage on the left of the machine. This will make 1 round of circular knitting. Cast-on complete!

## Set carriages for pattern knitting ##
1. Make sure carriage is fully on the left of the machine even if size of knitting is smaller.
2. Main carriage settings
  * Knob to KC-I OR KC-II (I usually use KC-II)
  * Depress both part :arrow_backward: and part :arrow_forward: buttons
![main_pattern_setting](/assets/3dbj/main_pattern_setting.jpg)
3. Ribber carriage settings
  * Both knobs to lili
  * Both sliders to P
![ribber_pattern_settings](/assets/3dbj/ribber_pattern_settings.jpg)
4. initialize ayab (can do earlier, I prefer to wait until my cast on is neatly complete)

## Begin Pattern Knitting ##
>You'll be knitting colors from white pixels to black pixels and back.
So the color order will be 
>1 - 2 - 3 - 2 
>or 
>White - Gray - Black - Gray
>While your colors may not match the pixels they will be referred to the colors as if your yarn is white, gray, and black.

1. With the white yarn make 2 passes of the carriage
2. With the gray yarn make 2 passes of the carriage
3. With the black yarn make 2 passes of the carriage
4. With the gray yarn make 2 passes of the carriage
5. repeat from * until piece is complete

## Bind-Off
There are many ways to bind off but this is a good standard method

## Choosing correct starting color if start line isn't 1 ##
If you're starting somewhere other than the beginning of the image **beware!**

Depending if you're on an odd or even row of the image will affect your starting color

Odd rows of the image will proceed to transmit white - gray - black
but even rows will go black - gray - white

This can be especially confusing while you're in the middle of unraveling rows to fix a mistake

If you need to restart knitting after repairing a mistake I would recommend unraveling your work until you've got either the white or black yarn on the RIGHT of your machine. 

This way you can make use of a blank pass where all the needles are in B position and set up for partial knitting to get the correct needles selected. 

You will have to remove your ribber connecting arm and reattach it to get the yarn threaded again without breaking it

## Tips for 4 color changer ##
It's adjustable! 

I used mine for over a year before I realized there we're knobs underneath to adjust the head that holds all the yarn. 

Some fiddling with this made it so that it mostly always cleanly grabs the right yarn now instead of me helping with my fingers.

If your yarns are sticky sometimes another color will try to come along for the ride. 

When knitting smaller pieces especially I usually place my hand on the other colors of yarn to the left of the knitting to help them separate cleanly before getting caught by the first needle.
